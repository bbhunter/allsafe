## üì± About

**Allsafe** is an intentionally vulnerable Android application designed for security enthusiasts, pentesters, and developers to learn about Android application security. Unlike typical CTF-style apps, Allsafe simulates a real-world application using modern libraries and technologies, providing a practical learning experience for identifying and exploiting Android vulnerabilities.

### üéØ Key Features

- **15+ Security Challenges** covering various vulnerability categories
- **Modern Tech Stack** using current Android development practices
- **Frida Challenges** for dynamic instrumentation practice
- **Real-world Scenarios** that mirror actual application vulnerabilities
- **Progressive Difficulty** from beginner to advanced levels
- **Clean UI/UX** with a hacker-themed terminal interface

## üöÄ Installation

### Prerequisites

- Android device or emulator (API 23+)
- ADB (Android Debug Bridge) installed
- (Optional) Frida for dynamic analysis challenges

### Download & Install

#### Option 1: Direct APK Installation
```bash
# Download the latest APK from releases
wget https://github.com/t0thkr1s/allsafe/releases/latest/download/allsafe.apk

# Install via ADB
adb install allsafe.apk
```

#### Option 2: Build from Source
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/t0thkr1s/allsafe.git
cd allsafe

# Build the APK
./gradlew assembleDebug

# Install the APK
adb install app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

## üéÆ Challenges

The application contains various security challenges organized by difficulty:

### Challenges

### 1. Insecure Logging

Simple information disclosure vulnerability. Use the `logcat` command-line tool to discover sensitive information.

###### Resources & HackerOne Reports:

- [Logcat Tool](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/logcat)
- [Coinbase OAuth Response Code Leak](https://hackerone.com/reports/5314)

<details>
<summary>Show me how it's done!</summary>
<br>
<code>adb shell 'pidof infosecadventures.allsafe'</code>
<br><br>
Take output and substitue for <pid>
<br><br>
<code>adb shell 'logcat --pid [PID] | grep secret'</code>
<br><br>
</details>

---

### 2. Hardcoded Credentials

Some credentials are left in the code. Your task is to reverse engineer the app and find sensitive information.

###### Resources & HackerOne Reports:

- [Zomato Hardcoded Credentials](https://hackerone.com/reports/246995)
- [8x8 Hardcoded Credentials](https://hackerone.com/reports/412772)
- [Reverb Hardcoded API Secret](https://hackerone.com/reports/351555)

---

### 3. Root Detection

This is purely for Frida practice. Make the code believe that your device is not rooted!

### 4. Arbitrary Code Execution

Loading modules securely with third-party apps are not easy. Write a PoC application and exploit the vulnerability!

###### Resources & HackerOne Reports:

- [Arbitrary Code Execution via Third-Party Package Contexts](https://blog.oversecured.com/Android-arbitrary-code-execution-via-third-party-package-contexts/)

---

### 5. Secure Flag Bypass

Another Frida-based task. No real vulnerability here, just have fun bypassing the secure flag!

###### Resources & HackerOne Reports:

- [Android FLAG_SECURE Reference](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/WindowManager.LayoutParams#FLAG_SECURE)

---

### 6. Certificate Pinning Bypass

Certificate pinning is implemented using the OkHttp library. You have to bypass it in order to view the traffic with Burp Suite.

###### Resources & HackerOne Reports:

- [Certificate and Public Key Pinning](https://owasp.org/www-community/controls/Certificate_and_Public_Key_Pinning)
- [Coinbase Vulnerabilities](https://hackerone.com/reports/5786)

---

### 7. Insecure Broadcast Receiver

There's a vulnerable broadcast recevier in the application. Trigger it with the correct data and you're done!

###### Resources & HackerOne Reports:

- [Android Broadcasts Overview](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/broadcasts)
- [ok.ru Broadcast Receiver Exploitation](https://hackerone.com/reports/97295)
- [Bitwarden Vulnerable Broadcast Receiver](https://hackerone.com/reports/289000)

---

### 8. Deep Link Exploitation

Similar to the insecure broadcast receiver, you need to provide the right query parameter to complete this task!

###### Resources & HackerOne Reports:

- [Android Deep Linking](https://developer.android.com/training/app-links/deep-linking)
- [Grab Insecure Deep Link](https://hackerone.com/reports/401793)
- [Periscope Deep Link CSRF](https://hackerone.com/reports/583987)

---

### 9. SQL Injection

Just a regular SQL injection that you'd find in web applications. No need to reverse the code to bypass the login mechanism.

###### Resources & HackerOne Reports:

- [SQL Injection in Content Provider](https://hackerone.com/reports/291764)

---

### 10. Vulnerable WebView

You can also complete this task without decompiling the application. Pop an alert dialog and read files!

###### Resources & HackerOne Reports:

- [ownCloud WebView XSS](https://hackerone.com/reports/87835)

---

### 11. Smali Patching

In this task, you have to modify the execution flow of the application by editing the Smali code. Finally, rebuild and sign the APK!

###### Resources & HackerOne Reports:

- [Uber APK Signer](https://github.com/patrickfav/uber-apk-signer)

---

### 12. Native Library

The application uses a native library that validates the entered password. Reverse engineer the library to find the password then use Frida to hook the native method.

- [Ghidra](https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra)
- [Cutter](https://github.com/rizinorg/cutter)
